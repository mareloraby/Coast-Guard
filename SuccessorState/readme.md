> In project 2 we implemented a simplified logic-based
version of the Coast Guard agent. This agent reasons using the situation calculus. 

**The following simplifying assumptions were made:**

- There are no black boxes to retrieve.

- There is only one station and a maximum of two ships.

- Each ship has exactly one passenger who does not expire with time.

- The agentâ€™s capacity can be either 1 or 2.

- The grid size is 3 X 3 or 4 X 4.
