> In project 2 we implemented a simplified logic-based
version of the Coast Guard agent. This agent reasons using the situation calculus. 

**We make the following simplifying assumptions:**

a) There are no black boxes to retrieve.

b) There is only one station and a maximum of two ships.

c) Each ship has exactly one passenger who does not expire with time.

d) The agentâ€™s capacity can be either 1 or 2.

e) The grid size is 3 X 3 or 4 X 4.
